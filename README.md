# Birdsong Self-supervised Learning

This repository complements the paper 'Using Self-Supervised Learning of Birdsong for Downstream Industrial Audio Classification' presented at ICML 2020 Workshop on Self-supervision in Audio and Speech on July 17, 2020.

In manufacturing settings, workers rely on their sense of hearing and their knowledge of what sounds correct to help them identify machine quality problems based on the sound pitch, rhythm, timbre and other characteristics of the sound of the machine in operation. Using machine learning to classify these sounds has broad applications for automating the manual quality recognition work currently being done, including automating machine operator training, automating quality control detection, and diagnostics across manufacturing and mechanical service industries.
